###  Global Terrorism Database Ideological Motivations of Terrorism in the United States

* globalterrorismdb_USideology_1970-2016.RData

This file is from  Miller, Erin, 2017, "Global Terrorism Database Ideological Motivations of Terrorism in the United States", and originally hosted at [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/SACQNK). 

It is a supplemental file that adds categories to all the incidents tracked by the GTD, such as Environmental extremism, Left-wing extremism, Right-wing extremism, Religious extremism, etc.

The categories only are as recent as 2016.

### Ideology categorization for 2017

* ideology_2017.csv

This is the Post's attempt to mimic the ideological categorization from the previous file.

Eventually we didn't feel comfortable mixing these data sets so we went back and categorized every incident in the United States ourselves.

### Ideology categorization for incidents between 2002 and 2017
